> Building a website for a nail salon chain in Ho Chi Minh City

## Problem encounter :beetle:
- Host onto live domain (Date: 06/15/2021 Fixed: 06/16/2021)
    + Create domain for hosting web for a first time
    + On 15/06, cannot deploy web to domain. Figured out that need to install express
    + Cannot load website on domain at the same day. Solution: Check that all package in require method should be installed. When initial <b>server</b> variable, it only uses method listen. Variable <b>app</b> use the remain method of the web app (in this version).

    * Maybe need to deploy web app to domain (heroku in this project) and git to remote origin after deployment.
